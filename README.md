# CephScrubManager
A simple tool to help manage the scrub operations in your ceph cluster so they don't bring it to it's knees everytime it does a deep-scrub.

TODO: Implement daemon
TODO: Implement threads to manage scrub and deep-scrub at the same time
TODO: Break up the cluster status instead of just checking for active+clean
TODO: switch to python-ceph if it makes this better to use and not more comlicated
